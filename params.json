{"name":"Sudoku Application","tagline":"EE205 Final Project: Jason Tanabe, Andy Ng, Tyler Isono, Matt Shinsato","body":"### Whats the Application?\r\nThe Sudoku App is an application that allows a user to generate sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties and solve them. Upon entering a value in each box, the inputs will be checked against the solution and will notify the user if they completed it correctly. The application also can solve some Sudoku puzzles given data of a puzzle.\r\n\r\n## How to Play?\r\n- Download the application, unzip the archive, Open the main executable file (sudokuapp.exe) and the game should start. \r\n- Click the Main Menu and select \"PLAY\", then select a button corresponding to a difficulty (EASY, MED, HARD). \r\n- Use ARROW KEYS to move choose the selected box (the character highlighted in green is the currently selected position). \r\n- Press the NUMBER KEYS 1-9 to change the value of the currently selected position. Numbers that are black are part of the original puzzle and cannot be changed. \r\n-The Hint button can be used to randomly display the correct value of a cell. This can only be used 3 times per a game. Note the cell that is chosen is random--so it may potentially \"reveal\" the cell value of a cell you have already have the correct value for.\r\n- Click the Give Up button if you give up and want to see the solution.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/nNPPRYd.png)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/VrVBTou.png)\r\n\r\n## Other\r\nThe close button is ignored (buttons were configured to be ignored since the resources have a relatively low resolution and we wanted to prevent users from trying to resize the window!) Exit using the Menu button when playing and then clicking Exit. \r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\nCurrently the solver suffers from an issue where if the user goes to play a game, goes back to main menu and then goes to solver, there will be a visual bug where the puzzle from the game mode displays. Avoid the issue by going directly to the solver upon running the application.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
